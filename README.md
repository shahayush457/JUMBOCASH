> Jumbotail is an online marketplace for food and grocery, targeted at kirana stores/wholesale distributors/vendors. These businesses buy from the Jumbotail marketplace for their retail sales. \
> This application aims at easing their life by allowing them to track their overall cash flow in one place, along with viewing and organizing historical data to look for patterns that can help them improve their business processes. Since most of these small businesses work on micro-credit, monitoring their overall cash flow regularly in one place is a boon.

## Installation and Usage

## Local -

Make sure you have Nodejs and react scripts installed globally in your system.
And if you want to use a local database then install mongodb as well in your system.

### Backend

```sh
$ cd JUMBOCASH/backend
$ cp .env.template .env.development
# Now fill all the env variables inside .env.development file.
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```sh
$ cd JUMBOCASH/client
# Add the google and facebook clientId in config file.
$ yarn install
# Start React DevServer: http://localhost:3000
$ yarn start
```

Now you can access the site locally at http://localhost:3000

## Production -

Make sure you have Nodejs installed globally in your server.

### Backend

```sh
$ cd JUMBOCASH/backend
$ cp .env.template .env.production
# Now fill all the env variables inside .env.production file.
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Frontend

```sh
$ cd JUMBOCASH/client
# Add the google, facebook clientId and server url in config file.
$ yarn build
```

Now you can deploy the production build created.

## Testing

This will run all the tests for the backend. \
**Note** - Don't use the development database for testing purposes. Instead use a test database and add its url in .env.test file.

```sh
$ cd JUMBOCASH/backend
$ cp .env.template .env.test
# Now fill all the env variables inside .env.test file.
$ npm test
```

## Docker :whale:

**Note** - You need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.

```sh
$ cd JUMBOCASH/backend
$ cp .env.template .env.production
# Now fill all the env variables inside .env.production file.
$ cd JUMBOCASH/client/src
# Add the google and facebook client id in config file.
$ cd JUMBOCASH
$ docker-compose up --build
```

This will build the images and start the docker containers for the backend, frontend and the mongodb database.
Now you can access your application at http://localhost/
